<p class="subtitle">B.E Biomedical Engineering</p>

<p class="about">Biomedical engineering program comprises study about tissue engineering, molecular or systems level biology/ physiology and mathematics. Students get to study about biomedical electronics, quantitative and analytical skills required to interpret data acquired and processing of medical data including imaging and enhancement techniques. Other aspects of the program include the study of biomechanics, cellular engineering, genetic engineering, orthopedic surgery, bio-instrumentation, medical imaging and bio-materials. Other important topics, about which the student will get to know include, about studying about advanced therapeutic and surgical devices, computer modeling of physiologic systems</p>
