<p class="about">Electronics and Communications Engineering (ECE) involves researching, designing, developing, and testing electronic equipment used in various systems. Electronics and Communications engineers also conceptualise and oversee the manufacturing of communications and broadcast systems. This stream of engineering deals with analogue transmission, basic electronics, microprocessors, solid-state devices, digital and analogue communication, analogue integrated circuits, microwave engineering, satellite communication, antennae, and wave progression. It also deals with the manufacturing of electronic devices, circuits, and communications equipment. In India, Electronics and Communications Engineering is offered by various colleges at the UG as well as PG level leading to BTech (4 years) and MTech (2 years) degrees respectively. </p>
